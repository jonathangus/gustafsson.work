I have been working professionally as a developer for 5+ years. The last couple of years I have been working exclusively with JavasScript building UI:s with **React**, backend with **Node** and native apps with **React Native**. I enjoy building applications from the ground up, including tech stack and design.

Working as a independant consultant for my own company **Git & Tonic AB**.
